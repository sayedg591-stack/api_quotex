"""
Backtest-based dynamic factor weighting for the Quotex Market Analyzer.

Replays each of the 10 confluence factors (bb, rsi_div, stoch, cci, candle,
mean_reversion, exhaustion, round_number, obv, sr) bar-by-bar across
already-fetched historical candles, and measures how often each factor's
vote correctly predicted price direction `lookahead` candles later. Purely
historical/statistical analysis on data already in memory — NEVER places
orders, NEVER calls any network/API function.

        current-moment broker value) — this can never be backtested,
